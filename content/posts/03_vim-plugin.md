Summary: Introducing a plugin to grep through your Vim's runtimepath & scriptnames.




When hacking on Vim itself, I often find myself staring at some error message
without any clear ideas of its cause or how to proceed. Thus I wrote a small
plugin to help tackle this problem.

Introducing [GrepRtpScr](https://github.com/jyscao/vim-greprtpscr), a plugin
for grepping through your Vim’s `scriptnames` & `runtimepath`, which should
help you to debug your loaded Vimscript sources, and remind you of all
loadable sources respectively.

Here’s an [asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/8VTauXdwR7Aqhqibfh98BUC7P)
(also in project README) with a quick demo.
