## Context

I was given this interesting take-home assignment while interviewing
for a company last year: implement a simple peer-to-peer network
of servers that communicate with each other using a [gossip
protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol).

These were their specified requirements:

* The network must support up to 16 individual servers (nodes) running
simultaneously.

* At any given time, each node can only have knowledge of 3 other nodes in the
network.

* At minimum, each node must provide two API methods:

```python
def submit_message(message: str) -> None:
    """Handle an incoming message."""

def get_messages() -> List[str]:
    """Returns a list of all messages since this node started.

    Each message should include the path it followed to reach this node.
    
    Example output:
    - Apple (Node 1 -> Node 8 -> Node 10)
    - Banana (Node 3 -> Node 5 -> Node 10)
    - Orange (Node 7 -> Node 15 -> Node 9 -> Node 10)
    """
```

* A message submitted to a single node should eventually be received by **all
nodes** in the network.

* Nodes can only communicate with each other through network calls (not
in-process function calls). The actual networking protocol is up to you, so
feel free to choose between TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.

* Your solution must be implemented in Python.

They provided stub classes for the client and the server, and a simple CLI
UI for interacting with the gossip network, so in effect, the design of the
system. So all that remained was for me to color in the boxes, so to speak.



## Getting Started

Of course, the first order of business was to install the necessary software
for development: Python 3, Docker and Poetry.

After installing the development dependencies (Python 3, Docker & [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))
and [fixing an issue](https://github.com/jyscao/dapper-labs-gossip/commit/af3a5a0a0d4de62d1416de58898fb567a420ba43)
with the poetry lockfile that failed to install the Python dependencies, I was
ready to test out the skeleton gossip network using the provided commands:

* `start-network` - spins up a network of 16 nodes using Docker Compose
* `stop-network` - stops all nodes running in the network
* `send-message` - send a message to a node once the network has been started
* `get-messages` - returns all messages received by a single node
* `remove-node` - stops a single node in the network

Unfortunately, I ran into another roadblock here in the form of getting the
nodes running as individual Docker containers to communicate with each other.
Being the Docker (and containers in general) hater that I am, I decided to
[rip out the entire Docker infrastructure and replace it with the simple to use `multiprocessing` module from Python's standard library](https://github.com/jyscao/dapper-labs-gossip/commit/0b7d19acd8519e3282551e13d86365e024632c4f).

Once that was all in place, I was finally ready to start implementing the
client and the server.



## Implementation Details

Let me showcase the components of the gossip network by taking you through,
roughly in sequence, what happens when one executes the `send-message` command
for example, to any given node.


### CLI & Client

The CLI is powered by the [`docopt`](http://docopt.org/) package, and invoked
through Poetry. So when the command `gossip send-message <node-number>
<message>` is executed, `docopt` parses then recognizes that the predefined
command `send-message` has been invoked, thus activating the following
conditional block:

```python
    elif args["send-message"]:
        message = args["<message>"]
        client = init_gossip_client(args["<node-number>"])
        client.send_message(message, relay_limit=int(args["--relays"]))
        print(f"Message sent to {client}")
```

Where `init_gossip_client` initializes and returns an instance of
`GossipClient` to the specified node, upon which the client's `send_message`
method (shown below) is invoked:

```python
    def send_message(self, message, is_relay=False, relay_limit=1):
        """Send a message to the current server."""
        cmd = "/RELAY" if is_relay else "/NEW"
        self._send_to_server(f"{cmd}:{relay_limit}|{message}")
```

The `_send_to_server` "private" method simply opens a TCP socket connection to
its corresponding `GossipServer`'s TCP server that's running on `localhost`
and a port uniquely determined by the `<node-number>`.

In the case of a new message sent to a node, the `cmd` metadata which is
prepended to the entire text streamed to the server, is set to `"/NEW"`.
The `"/RELAY"` `cmd` metadata is used when intermediate nodes pass received
messages to their neighbors.

This pseudo-IRC-command metadata will be discussed in more detail in the
Message Handling subsection of the server implementation below.


### Server

Each node's server `GossipServer` has the single public method `start` that's
called on `start-network`, creating an instance of `GossipTCPServer`, which
inherits from [`socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer),
thereby giving it the method [`serve_forever`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.BaseServer.serve_forever):

```python
class GossipServer:
    """A server that participates in a peer-to-peer gossip network."""

    def __init__(self, server_address, peer_addrs):
        """Initialize a server with a list of peer addresses.

        Peer addresses are in the form HOSTNAME:PORT.
        """
        hostname, port = server_address.split(":")
        self.host_port_tup = (hostname, int(port))
        self.ss = ServerSettings(hostname, port, peer_addrs)

    def start(self):
        print(f"Starting Gossip-Node-{self.ss.node_id} with peers:".ljust(36) + f" {', '.join(str(p.id) for p in self.ss.peers)}")
        with GossipTCPServer(self.host_port_tup, GossipMessageHandler, self.ss) as server:
            server.serve_forever()
```

#### Server Settings

The class member `ss` above is the `ServerSettings` dataclass shown below,
which essentially holds all the configuration data (`hostname`, `port`,
`node_id`, etc.) and state (`peers`, received messages stored in `msgs_box`)
of each node's server instance:

```python
@dataclass
class ServerSettings:
    hostname:   str
    port:       int
    peer_addrs: list[str]
    node_id:    int = None
    peers:      list[GossipClient] = field(init=False)
    msgs_box:   dict[dict] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

#### Message Handling

Of course, the bulk of the work is done by the `GossipMessageHandler`, which
subclasses [`socketserver.StreamRequestHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.StreamRequestHandler):

```python
class GossipMessageHandler(StreamRequestHandler):

    def handle(self):
        self.cmd, self.msg_data = self.rfile.readline().strip().decode().split(":", maxsplit=1)
        self._get_cmd_handler()()

    def _get_cmd_handler(self):
        return {
            "/NEW":   self._proc_new_msg,
            "/RELAY": self._proc_relayed_msg,
            "/GET":   self._send_client_msgs_data,
            "/PEERS": self._get_peers_info,
            "/REMOVE": self._remove_peer,
        }[self.cmd]

```

As you can see from the definition of `_get_cmd_handler` above,
`GossipMessageHandler` recognizes 5 different types of commands, which are
specified using the aforementioned pseudo-IRC-like command syntax.

When the bytestream from the node's client is recieved and handled by the
server, the data is split into 2 portions: the command and the message data.
In our example of the `"/NEW"` command, the `_proc_new_msg` method is called
to handle it:

```python
    def _proc_new_msg(self):
        self._set_relay_limit_and_msg_text_on_send()
        self.msg_id = f"{self.msg_content}_{time.time_ns()}"
        self.curr_msg_attrs = self.server.ss.msgs_box[self.msg_id] = self._init_new_msg_attrs()
        self.node_path = [self.server.ss.node_id]
        self._save_path_and_relay()
```

First the `msg_data` is parsed to set the `relay_limit`[^1], and the message
content. Then the current timestamp is appended to the messge content to
create the unique `msg_id`. Next a metatdata map is initialized for the
current message with `_init_new_msg_attrs`:

[^1]: The `relay_limit`, which defaults to 1, is an important parameter that
determines the number of times each node broadcasts a received message to all
of its neighboring nodes. If when executing `send-message` with `--relays=3`
for example, then each node, instead of receiving a message 3 times (once
from each of its 3 neighbors), they would receive it 9 times (3 per node Ã— 3
nodes).

```python
    def _init_new_msg_attrs(self):
        return {
            "in_paths":   [],
            "in_counts":  Counter({p.id: 0 for p in self.server.ss.peers}),
            "out_counts": Counter({p.id: 0 for p in self.server.ss.peers}),
            "is_unread":  True,
        }
```

The `"in_paths"` key will come to contain the list of nodes this message has
traversed to reach the current node. The `"in_counts"` & `"out_counts"` are
respectively used to track whether the current node should accept and save
the incoming message, and broadcast it back out to its neighbor nodes, as
determined by the value of `relay_limit`.

Finally the new message is saved into the `ss.msg_box` `dict` of the node, and
relayed onwards to its peers. As implemented here:

```python
    def _save_path_and_relay(self):
        self.curr_msg_attrs["in_paths"].append(self.node_path)
        self._relay_to_peers((self.msg_id, self.node_path))

    def _relay_to_peers(self, data):
        for p in self._get_peers_to_relay():
            if self.curr_msg_attrs["out_counts"][p.id] < self.relay_limit:
                p.send_message(json.dumps(data), is_relay=True, relay_limit=self.relay_limit)
                self.curr_msg_attrs["out_counts"][p.id] += 1

    def _get_peers_to_relay(self):
        if self.cmd == "/NEW":
            return self.server.ss.peers
        elif self.cmd == "/RELAY":
            # filter out the preceeding node which relayed the current message to this node
            return [p for p in self.server.ss.peers if p.id != self.prev_node]
        else:
            raise Exception("this should never be reached!")
```

As you can see, when the message sent to the node is new (command is
`"/NEW"`), the current node will relay the message to all of its neighbors
using their clients (`p.send_message(...)`)[^2]. But if the message was
already one that has been relayed to it from a previous node, the node
will skip the upstream relaying node when proceeding with its own relaying
responsibilities.

[^2]: These neighbor nodes, of course would then save the relayed message,
and in-turn continue the relaying to their own respective neighbors. An
alternative messaging mechanism would be to check if a node has already
received the same message from another neighbor; if not save and relay as is
done here; if so, then skip the processing of this redundant message. Each
approach has their own pros and cons.


### Peers & Network Graphs

The last important piece in the implementation of this gossip network is the
component responsible for the network topology and thus peers assignment.

You may recall seeing in the `ServerSettings` dataclass shown earlier that
each node's server contained a `peers` property of type `list[GossipClient]`.
It's certainly fair to question exactly how the peers of each node are
assigned, and by extension the network as a whole is constructed. As is often
the case in Python, a mature and robust library exists for one's domain of
interest, which in our case is [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/): a Python
package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics,
and functions of complex networks.

#### Ciruclar Network

NetworkX provides [generator functions](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html)
for over a hundred types of graphs. It was trivial to use its `cycle_graph`
generator to replace the stub graph generator provided in the original project
specs. Once a basic [undirected `Graph`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/graph.html)
object has been created based on the desired parameters (e.g. the number of
nodes), useful operations such as retrieving the neighbors/peers of any given
node is provided out-of-the-box by its API.

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 1: circular network of 16 nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Random Network

Along the same vein, generating a random network is also straightforward
by utilizing `random_regular_graph`. In addition to specifying
the number of nodes *n*, we must also pass the degree *d* of each
node, which defaults to 3, as specified in the original problem
requirement. Note that *nÃ—d* must be even, by the [handshaking
lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking_lemma).

<figure>
<img src="images/06-3_random-network.jpeg" style="width:100%;"
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 2: random network of 16 nodes with 3 neighbors each</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Power Law Network

There's also a powerlaw degree distribution network, generated using
[`powerlaw_cluster_graph`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.powerlaw_cluster_graph.html),
available. One such instance is this:

<figure>
<img src="images/06-4_powerlaw-network.jpeg" style="width:100%;"
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 3: power law network of 16 nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

#### TurÃ¡n Network

Adding a new type of network is also quite simple, which I shall demonstrate
by example. After adding the new network type to the `docopt` CLI
description in `gossip/cli.py`, and correctly handling its parameters
in `gossip/start_network.py`, we'd just need to actually implement in
`gossip/network.py` the `TuranNetwork` class that will generate the graph
object:

```python
class TuranNetwork(GossipNetwork):

    def __init__(self, num_nodes, r_partitions):
        self.r_parts = r_partitions
        super().__init__(num_nodes)

    def _get_network_graph(self):
        return nx.turan_graph(self.num_nodes, self.r_parts)
```

The above is all it takes to add a new network type to test how it works with
a gossip protocol. As you can see, it's not doing much more than just calling
the [built-in TurÃ¡n graph generator](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.classic.turan_graph.html)
provided by NetworkX.

To make the key property[^3] of the TurÃ¡n graph more evident, I
also overrode the `_draw_network` method inherited from the `GossipNetwork`
class, thereby giving us the following representation:

[^3]: [TurÃ¡n graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tur%C3%A1n_graph): complete
multipartite graph; it is formed by partitioning a set of *n* vertices into
*r* subsets, with sizes as equal as possible, and then connecting two vertices
by an edge if and only if they belong to different subsets.

<figure>

## Demonstration

With the hardwork out of the way, let us now take a look at what the (more or
less) finished product can do.

Using the concrete example of the [random network](#random-network) shown in
Fig. 2 above, let's first send a message to node 1:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip send-message 1 "Hello World"
Message sent to Gossip-Node-1
```

Then let's get the messages of node 10:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip get-messages 10
Fetched all messages from Gossip-Node-10; showing all path(s):

â€¢ Hello World
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10
  â†³ 1 âžœ 14 âžœ 12 âžœ 4 âžœ 9 âžœ 10
  â†³ 1 âžœ 14 âžœ 12 âžœ 4 âžœ 16 âžœ 8 âžœ 10
```

By default, the command will display all paths taken by the message to reach
the node in question, of which there are 3 here, 1 from each neighbor. We can
also tell it to display the shortest, longest, & shortest + longest paths
using the `-p`, `-p` & `-ppp` flags respectively. For example on node 6:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip get-messages 6 -pp
Fetched all messages from Gossip-Node-6; showing shortest & longest path(s):

â€¢ Hello World
  â†³ 1 âžœ 11 âžœ 6
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10 âžœ 8 âžœ 2 âžœ 7 âžœ 6
```

The `get-messages` command can optionally return only read or unread messages;
a message on node *x* becomes "read" once it has been retrieved with `poetry
run gossip get-messages x`. Additionally, you can pass it the repeatable `-t`
flag to view the timestamp of messages with varying levels of detail.

Next let's list the peers of node 4:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip list-peers 4
Gossip-Node-4 has peers:
* Gossip-Node-9 (127.0.0.1:7009)
* Gossip-Node-12 (127.0.0.1:7012)
* Gossip-Node-16 (127.0.0.1:7016)
```

Followed by removing one of its peers, say node 12:

```bash
poetry run gossip remove-node 12
Gossip-Node-12 removed
```

Now we see node 4 only has 2 peers[^4]:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip list-peers 4
Gossip-Node-4 has peers:
* Gossip-Node-9 (127.0.0.1:7009)
* Gossip-Node-16 (127.0.0.1:7016)
```

[^4]: Currently, once a node has been removed from the network, its erstwhile
neighbors simply have their degree of connectedness reduced by 1. An
improvement would be to reconfigure the network, where it's possible without
violating the handshaking lemma, to connect nodes that have lost this
neighbor.

And if we send another message to the network:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip send-message 1 "Goodbye"
Message sent to Gossip-Node-1
```

Then check the message box of node 4:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip get-messages 4
Fetched all messages from Gossip-Node-4; showing all path(s):

â€¢ Hello World
  â†³ 1 âžœ 14 âžœ 12 âžœ 4
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10 âžœ 9 âžœ 4
  â†³ 1 âžœ 11 âžœ 6 âžœ 7 âžœ 16 âžœ 4

â€¢ Goodbye
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10 âžœ 9 âžœ 4
  â†³ 1 âžœ 11 âžœ 6 âžœ 7 âžœ 16 âžœ 4
```

We can see the path that allowed the first message "Hello World" to reach
node 4 from node 12, is no longer available when we sent the second message
"Goodbye". Though of course, due to the inherent redundancy of the gossip
network, the message still reached its destination, which is the entire point.



## Final Words

When working with decentralized networks, gossip as a family of protocols
can certainly be a valuable tool to achieve certain desired behaviors.
One example of a real-world production-ready software that uses gossip is
[Tribler](https://www.tribler.org/), a decentralized anonymous P2P BitTorrent
client. Gossip is at the core of how Tribler users discover available and
high-quality "channels", which are collections of shareable content along with
their metadata.

Although my toy example is far from being production-ready for any practical
utilities, I do hope the walkthrough provided an adequate high-level
understanding of how pieces of such a system can be put together, as well as
useful implemntation details showcasing how the `send-message` command is both
initiated and handled.
