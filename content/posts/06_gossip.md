## Context

I was given an interesting take-home assignment while interviewing for a
company last year: implement a simple peer-to-peer network of servers that
communicate with each other using a [gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol).

These were their requirements:

* The network must support up to 16 individual servers (nodes) running
simultaneously

* At any given time, each node can only have knowledge of 3 other nodes in the
network

* At minimum, each node must provide two API methods:

```python
def submit_message(message: str) -> None:
    """Handle an incoming message."""

def get_messages() -> List[str]:
    """Returns a list of all messages since this node started.

    Each message should include the path it followed to reach this node.
    
    Example output:
    - Apple (Node 1 -> Node 8 -> Node 10)
    - Banana (Node 3 -> Node 5 -> Node 10)
    - Orange (Node 7 -> Node 15 -> Node 9 -> Node 10)
    """
```

* A message submitted to a single node should eventually be received by **all
nodes** in the network

* Nodes can only communicate with each other through network calls (TCP, UDP,
HTTP, etc.), not in-process function calls

* The solution must be implemented in Python

They provided stub classes for the client and the server, plus a simple CLI
for interacting with the gossip network. In effect, the design of the system.
Thus all that remained was for me to color in the boxes, so to speak.



## Getting Started

The first order of business was to install the necessary base software: Python
3, Docker and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

After installing these and fixing an issue with the poetry lockfile that
failed to install the Python dependencies[^1], I was ready to inspect and
experiment the skeleton gossip network using their provided commands:

[^1]: [`poetry.lock` fix](https://github.com/jyscao/gossip-network-example/commit/ca21ab71402d7d869a57feed952db57baacf0de1)

* `start-network`: spins up a network of 16 nodes using Docker Compose
* `stop-network`:  stops all nodes running in the network
* `send-message`:  send a message to a node once the network has been started
* `get-messages`:  returns all messages received by a single node
* `remove-node`:   stops a single node in the network

Unfortunately, I ran into another blocker here: the nodes nodes, which ran
as individual Docker containers, could not communicate with each other.
Being a Docker/containers skeptic, I decided to rip out the entire Docker
infrastructure and replace it with the simple to use `multiprocessing` module
from Python's standard library[^2].

[^2]: [Removing Docker](https://github.com/jyscao/gossip-network-example/commit/3c97e6d7249304d977c290775db8bea09fcd9cca)

Once that was all in place, I was finally ready to start implementing the
client and the server.



## Implementation Details

I shall showcase the components of the gossip network by walking you through,
roughly in sequence, what happens when one executes the `send-message` command
to any given node.


### CLI & Client

The CLI is powered by the [`docopt`](http://docopt.org/) package, and invoked
through Poetry. So when the command "`gossip send-message <node-number>
<message>`" is executed, `docopt` parses then recognizes that the predefined
command `send-message` has been invoked, thereby activating its following
conditional:

```python
    elif args["send-message"]:
        message = args["<message>"]
        client = init_gossip_client(args["<node-number>"])
        client.send_message(message, relay_limit=int(args["--relays"]))
        print(f"Message sent to {client}")
```

Where `init_gossip_client` initializes and returns an instance of
`GossipClient` to the specified node, upon which the client's `send_message`
method below is invoked:

```python
    def send_message(self, message, is_relay=False, relay_limit=1):
        """Send a message to the current server."""
        cmd = "/RELAY" if is_relay else "/NEW"
        self._send_to_server(f"{cmd}:{relay_limit}|{message}")
```

The `_send_to_server` "private" method opens a TCP socket connection
to its corresponding `GossipServer`'s TCP-server running on
`localhost:<node-number>`.

When a new message is sent to a node (as in our example), `cmd` is set to
`"/NEW"`. While intermediate nodes forwarding messages to their own neighbors
sets `cmd` to `"/RELAY"`. The `cmd` metadata is then prepended to the entire
text streamed to the server.

This pseudo-IRC-command `cmd` metadata will be explained in more detail in the
[Message Handling](#message-handling) subsection of the server implementation
below.


### Server

Each node's `GossipServer` has the single public method `start`, which is
called on execution of the `start-network` command. This creates an instance
of `GossipTCPServer`, which subclasses [`socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer),
thus providing the method [`serve_forever`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.BaseServer.serve_forever):

```python
class GossipServer:
    """A server that participates in a peer-to-peer gossip network."""

    def __init__(self, server_address, peer_addrs):
        """Initialize a server with a list of peer addresses.

        Peer addresses are in the form HOSTNAME:PORT.
        """
        hostname, port = server_address.split(":")
        self.host_port_tup = (hostname, int(port))
        self.ss = ServerSettings(hostname, port, peer_addrs)

    def start(self):
        print(f"Starting Gossip-Node-{self.ss.node_id} with peers:".ljust(36) + f" {', '.join(str(p.id) for p in self.ss.peers)}")
        with GossipTCPServer(self.host_port_tup, GossipMessageHandler, self.ss) as server:
            server.serve_forever()
```

#### Server Settings

The property `ss` above is the `ServerSettings` dataclass shown below, which
essentially holds all the configuration data (`hostname`, `port`, `node_id`,
etc.) and state (`peers`, received messages stored in `msgs_box`) for each
node:

```python
@dataclass
class ServerSettings:
    hostname:   str
    port:       int
    peer_addrs: list[str]
    node_id:    int = None
    peers:      list[GossipClient] = field(init=False)
    msgs_box:   dict[dict] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

#### Message Handling

The bulk of the work is of course performed by `GossipMessageHandler`:

```python
class GossipMessageHandler(StreamRequestHandler):

    def handle(self):
        self.cmd, self.msg_data = self.rfile.readline().strip().decode().split(":", maxsplit=1)
        self._get_cmd_handler()()

    def _get_cmd_handler(self):
        return {
            "/NEW":   self._proc_new_msg,
            "/RELAY": self._proc_relayed_msg,
            "/GET":   self._send_client_msgs_data,
            "/PEERS": self._get_peers_info,
            "/REMOVE": self._remove_peer,
        }[self.cmd]

```

As you can see from the definition of `_get_cmd_handler` above, 5 commands,
encoded in the aforementioned pseudo-IRC-command style, are recognized.

When the bytestream from the node's client is recieved and handled by the
server, the data is split into 2 portions: the command and the message data.
In our example with the `"/NEW"` command, `_proc_new_msg` will be called to
handle it:

```python
    def _proc_new_msg(self):
        self._set_relay_limit_and_msg_text_on_send()
        self.msg_id = f"{self.msg_content}_{time.time_ns()}"
        self.curr_msg_attrs = self.server.ss.msgs_box[self.msg_id] = self._init_new_msg_attrs()
        self.node_path = [self.server.ss.node_id]
        self._save_path_and_relay()
```

First the `msg_data` is parsed to set the `relay_limit`[^3], and the message
content. Second the current timestamp is appended to the messge content to
create its unique `msg_id`. Then a metatdata `dict` is initialized for the
current message using `_init_new_msg_attrs`:

[^3]: The `relay_limit`, which defaults to 1, is an important parameter that
determines the number of times each node broadcasts a received message to all
of its neighboring nodes. When executing `send-message` with `--relays=3`
for example, then each node, instead of receiving a message 3 times (once
from each of its 3 neighbors), they would receive it 9 times (3/node Ã— 3
nodes).

```python
    def _init_new_msg_attrs(self):
        return {
            "in_paths":   [],
            "in_counts":  Counter({p.id: 0 for p in self.server.ss.peers}),
            "out_counts": Counter({p.id: 0 for p in self.server.ss.peers}),
            "is_unread":  True,
        }
```

The `"in_paths"` key will come to contain the list of nodes this message has
traversed to reach the current node. The `"in_counts"` & `"out_counts"` are
respectively used to track whether the current node should accept then save
the incoming message, and broadcast it back out (again) to its neighbors, as
determined by the value of `relay_limit`.

The new message and its metadata are saved into the node's `ss.msg_box`. Then
finally, relayed onwards to its peers through `_save_path_and_relay`:

```python
    def _save_path_and_relay(self):
        self.curr_msg_attrs["in_paths"].append(self.node_path)
        self._relay_to_peers((self.msg_id, self.node_path))

    def _relay_to_peers(self, data):
        for p in self._get_peers_to_relay():
            if self.curr_msg_attrs["out_counts"][p.id] < self.relay_limit:
                p.send_message(json.dumps(data), is_relay=True, relay_limit=self.relay_limit)
                self.curr_msg_attrs["out_counts"][p.id] += 1

    def _get_peers_to_relay(self):
        if self.cmd == "/NEW":
            return self.server.ss.peers
        elif self.cmd == "/RELAY":
            # filter out the preceeding node which relayed the current message to this node
            return [p for p in self.server.ss.peers if p.id != self.prev_node]
        else:
            raise Exception("this should never be reached!")
```

As you can see above in `_get_peers_to_relay`, when a message sent to the
node is `"/NEW"`, the current node will relay the message to all of its
neighbors `server.ss.peers` through the `p.send_message(...)` calls in
`_relay_to_peers`[^4]. But if the message was already one that has been
relayed to it from a previous node (`self.cmd == "/RELAY"`), the `prev_node`
will be filtered out, and skipped as the current node proceeds with its own
relaying responsibilities.

[^4]: These neighbor nodes would then save the relayed message, and in-turn
continue the relaying to their own respective neighbors. An alternative
messaging mechanism would be to check if a node has already received the same
message from another neighbor; if not, save and relay as normal; if so, then
skip the processing of this redundant message. Both approaches have their own
pros and cons.


### Peers & Network Graphs

The last core component of this gossip network is the piece responsible
for the network topology and peers assignment. You may recall from the
`ServerSettings` dataclass definition [shown earlier](#server-settings) that
each server node contains a `peers` property of type `list[GossipClient]`.
How exactly are these peers assigned, and by extension the entire network
constructed?

As is often the case with Python, a mature and robust library exists for one's
domain of interest, which in our case is [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/):
a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure,
dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

NetworkX provides [graph generators](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html)
for over a hundred types of graphs. Once a [`Graph`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/graph.html)

object has been instantiated with the desired parameters like the number of
nodes, useful operations such as retrieving the neighbors/peers of any given
node are provided as primitives by its API. Giving us exactly what's needed.

#### Ciruclar Network

Using NetworkX's `cycle_graph` generator, it was trivial to replace the stub
graph generator provided in the original project scaffold.

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 1: circular network of 16 nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Random Network

Along the same vein, generating a random network is also straightforward with
`random_regular_graph`. In addition to specifying the number of nodes *n*, we
must also pass the degree *d* of each node, which defaults to 3 (as specified
in the problem requirements). Note that *nÃ—d* must be an even integer, by the
[handshaking lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking_lemma).

<figure>
<img src="images/06-3_random-network.jpeg" style="width:70%;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 2: random network of 16 nodes with 3 neighbors each</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Power Law Network

There also exists [`powerlaw_cluster_graph`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.powerlaw_cluster_graph.html),
a power law degree distribution generator. Here is an example of such a
network:

<figure>
<img src="images/06-4_powerlaw-network.jpeg" style="width:70%;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 3: power law network of 16 nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

#### TurÃ¡n Network

Adding a new type of network can also be done with relative ease, which I
shall demonstrate by example.

First, we'd need to add the new network type to the `docopt` CLI
description in `gossip/cli.py`, and correctly handle its parameters in
`gossip/start_network.py`.

Then we'd implement `TuranNetwork` as a new subclass of `GossipNetwork` inside
`gossip/network.py`:

```python
class TuranNetwork(GossipNetwork):

    def __init__(self, num_nodes, r_partitions):
        self.r_parts = r_partitions
        super().__init__(num_nodes)

    def _get_network_graph(self):
        return nx.turan_graph(self.num_nodes, self.r_parts)
```

As you can see, it's not doing much more than transparently calling NetworkX's
built-in [TurÃ¡n graph generator](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.classic.turan_graph.html).

To make the key property of the TurÃ¡n graph more evident[^5], I also overrode
the `_draw_network` method inherited from the `GossipNetwork` parent class,
which gives us the more visually-intuitive representation below:

[^5]: [TurÃ¡n graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tur%C3%A1n_graph): complete
multipartite graph; it is formed by partitioning a set of *n* vertices into
*r* subsets, with sizes as equal as possible, and then connecting two vertices
by an edge if and only if they belong to different subsets.

<figure>

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: TurÃ¡n network of 16 nodes with 4 partitions</figcaption>
</figure>

Feel free to review the full patch adding the TurÃ¡n network [here](https://github.com/jyscao/dapper-labs-gossip/commit/375a79dd760b20c95617d90be5cfbb648ab22698).



## Demonstration

With the hard work out of the way, let's now take a look at what the (more or
less) finished product can do.

Using the concrete example of the [random network](#random-network) shown in
Fig. 2 above, let's first send a message to node 1:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip send-message 1 "Hello World"
Message sent to Gossip-Node-1
```

Then check the messages received by node 10:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip get-messages 10
Fetched all messages from Gossip-Node-10; showing all path(s):

â€¢ Hello World
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10
  â†³ 1 âžœ 14 âžœ 12 âžœ 4 âžœ 9 âžœ 10
  â†³ 1 âžœ 14 âžœ 12 âžœ 4 âžœ 16 âžœ 8 âžœ 10
```

By default, the command will display all paths taken by the message to reach
the node in question, of which there are 3 here, one each from node 10's
neighbors: `1`, `9` & `8` respectively to the paths shown above.

We can also tell it to display the shortest, longest, & shortest + longest
paths using the `-p`, `-p` & `-ppp` flags respectively. For example on node 6:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip get-messages 6 -pp
Fetched all messages from Gossip-Node-6; showing shortest & longest path(s):

â€¢ Hello World
  â†³ 1 âžœ 11 âžœ 6
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10 âžœ 8 âžœ 2 âžœ 7 âžœ 6
```

The `get-messages` command can optionally return just the read or unread
messages; a message on node *x* becomes "read" once it has been retrieved
with `poetry run gossip get-messages x`. Additionally, you can pass it the
repeatable `-t` flag to view the timestamp of messages with varying levels of
detail.

Next let's list the peers of node 4:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip list-peers 4
Gossip-Node-4 has peers:
* Gossip-Node-9 (127.0.0.1:7009)
* Gossip-Node-12 (127.0.0.1:7012)
* Gossip-Node-16 (127.0.0.1:7016)
```

Followed by removing one of its peers, say node 12:

```bash
poetry run gossip remove-node 12
Gossip-Node-12 removed
```

Now we see node 4 only has 2 peers remaining[^6]:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip list-peers 4
Gossip-Node-4 has peers:
* Gossip-Node-9 (127.0.0.1:7009)
* Gossip-Node-16 (127.0.0.1:7016)
```

[^6]: Currently, once a node has been removed from the network, its erstwhile
neighbors simply have their degree of connectedness reduced by 1. An
improvement would be to reconfigure the network, where it's possible without
violating the handshaking lemma, to connect nodes that have lost this
neighbor.

And if we send another message to the network by way of node 1:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip send-message 1 "Goodbye"
Message sent to Gossip-Node-1
```

Then check the message box of node 4:

```bash
$ poetry run gossip get-messages 4
Fetched all messages from Gossip-Node-4; showing all path(s):

â€¢ Hello World
  â†³ 1 âžœ 14 âžœ 12 âžœ 4
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10 âžœ 9 âžœ 4
  â†³ 1 âžœ 11 âžœ 6 âžœ 7 âžœ 16 âžœ 4

â€¢ Goodbye
  â†³ 1 âžœ 10 âžœ 9 âžœ 4
  â†³ 1 âžœ 11 âžœ 6 âžœ 7 âžœ 16 âžœ 4
```

We can see the path that allowed the first message `"Hello World"` to reach
node 4 from node 12, is no longer usable when we sent the second message
`"Goodbye"`. But of course, due to the built-in redundancy in the gossip
network, the message still reached its destination, which is the entire point.



## Final Words

When working with decentralized networks, gossip as a family of protocols can
certainly be a valuable tool to achieve certain desired behaviors. Here are a
couple real-world production-ready examples:

* [Serf](https://www.serf.io/): the service orchestration and management tool
from HashiCorp. It uses an efficient and lightweight gossip protocol [to
broadcast messages to the cluster](https://www.serf.io/docs/internals/gossip.html).

* [Tribler](https://www.tribler.org/): a decentralized anonymous P2P
BitTorrent client. It uses gossip to enable Tribler users [to discover
available and high-quality "channels"](https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/blob/main/doc/metadata_store/channels_architecture.rst),
which are collections of shareable content along with their metadata.

Although this toy project is far from being production-ready for any practical
utilities, I do hope the walkthrough provided an adequate high-level
understanding of how pieces of such a system can be put together, as well as
useful implementation details in the `send-message` example showcasing how
commands are both initiated and handled.

If you wish to play around with this example, you can find the full project
code on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/jyscao/gossip-network-example).
